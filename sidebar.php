					<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
					<p> Anyone with a great idea for change in the neighborhood can find volunteers and promote their project.
					<p>To be post a project, you must:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> Have primarily public benefit, rather than private benefit.</li>
							<li>Benefit your neighborhood's community, local environment or both.</li>
							<li>Produce tangible results. These should be immediately apparent to one or more of our five senses.</li>
							<li>Be local to the project site.</li>
						</ul>

					<p>When you post your project on gtown volunteers, you can instantly find new volunteers: All you need to do is share your idea: Just tell us a little more about yourself and your awesome idea.</p>
